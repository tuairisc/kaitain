 * Where is the CSS?!
 * ------------------
 * The appearance of the Tuairisc site, excluding some plugins, was an aggregate
 * of four stylesheets and one set of injected CSS:
 * 
 * 1. style.css - the root Gazeti stylesheet.
 * 2. media-queries.css - responsive styling rules for the Gazeti theme.
 * 3. silver.css - the Gazeti Silver theme.
 * 4. custom.css - user-input custm CSS.
 * 
 * For the purposes of our work, we focused on custom.css. We added something 
 * north of one thousand lines of CSS to this file. This was eventually 
 * refactored into a SCSS framework in February 2015.
 * 
 * In April 2015 we decided to completely replace the rest of Gazeti's CSS in
 * order to comply with the terms of both the GPL and the developer's wish for
 * us to excise any remaining code.
 *
 * Update April 22: We said 'fuck it' and went for an entire rebuild because we
 * have been steadily moving away from WPZOOM and Gazeti since day 1. 
 * 
 * /All/ of the presentation style can be found in /assets/sass/ in the form of
 * uncompiled Sass files. To stop a pointless compiled file from polluting git
 * commits, I have excluded the compiled tuairisc.scss.
 * 
 * The Tuairisc style is copyrighted, property of Tuairisc Bheo Treo and 
 * excluded from the GPL license that covers the functional PHP code in this
 * theme.
