# Tuairisc.ie
This repository is the WordPress theme for the [Tuairisc.ie](http://www.tuairisc.ie) rebuild. **THIS THEME IS UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT AS OF MAY 25 2015.** 

## Description
This is the WordPress theme for [Tuairisc.ie](http://www.tuairisc.ie). The Sass appearance framework is wholly original code. I'm not sure how much excitement you expect from a WordPress theme, but this is a responsive, modern theme. It runs /okay-ish/. I like ponies.
